### Getting Started

It couldn't be easier to start converting!

1. Download and unzip the app folder.
2. Run the executable file (`PicShift.exe`).
3. Simply drag your image file (e.g., a `.png` or `.ico` file) into the app window, or use the "Select File" button.
4. That's it! The converted file will automatically be saved right next to the original file in the same folder.

## Important Notes/Shortcomings

* **Platform:** This is Windows only.
* **rRsolution:** This is mainly meant to be used for icons. As such it supports a max size of only 1024px. I will add larger sizes later.
* **Single File Focus:** Please remember that only **one** file conversion can be run at a time.
* **Extension Check:** Ensure your source file has the correct extension (`.png`, `ico`, etc.) for smooth conversion.
* **Windows SmartScreen Warning:** If Windows Defender/SmartScreen shows a warning, please click **"More info"** then **"Run anyway"** This is standard for unsigned, custom apps, but rest assured, the file is completely safe.
